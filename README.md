**Airbnb Geospatial Analysis**

This project is a web-based application that performs geospatial analysis on Airbnb data. The application allows users to select a country, city, and price range to view a map of available hotels, along with their prices and ratings. The application also provides exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to help users understand the distribution of prices and availability by country and city.

**Features**

* Geospatial analysis: View a map of available hotels in a selected country and city, along with their prices and ratings.
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools:
	+ Histograms: View the distribution of prices by country and city.
	+ Box plots: View the distribution of prices by country and city.
	+ Scatter plots: View the relationship between price and availability by country and city.
* Filtering: Select a country, city, and price range to view relevant data.
